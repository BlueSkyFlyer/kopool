Issue of login page rendering multiple times

In AngularJS, anything wrapped in double curly braces is an expression that gets evaluated at least once during the digest cycle.

AngularJS works by running the digest cycle continuously until nothing has changed. That's how it ensures the view is up-to-date. Since you called a function, it's running it once to get a value and then a second time to see that nothing has changed. On the next digest cycle, it will run at least once again.
