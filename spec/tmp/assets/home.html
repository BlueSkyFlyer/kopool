      <h2>NFL Teams</h2>
      <p>Administrators can use this 'NFL Teams' button to view, edit, and update NFL teams.  Make sure the teams are all in the correct Conference and Division.  Upload a nice looking logo for each team.  Any logo you upload will automatically be stored on your Amazon S3 account and will automatically be scaled to "Medium" (300x300) and "Thumbnail" (100x100) sizes.</p>

      <h2>Weeks (Season 1)</h2>
      <p>Administrators can use this 'Weeks' button to view, edit, and update weeks.  Make sure all of the dates are correct.  You must always enter and edit them in international format: yyyy-mm-dd.  Also, currently there is a bug where the timezone is messing up the weeks.  You may have to enter hours also:  yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm.  Jack and Dave will discuss.</p>
